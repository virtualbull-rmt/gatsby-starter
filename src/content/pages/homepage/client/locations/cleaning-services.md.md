  headline: Good to know
  questions:
    - question: Am I insured for damage?
      answer: >-
        Usually you are already insured for damage through your home contents or
        building insurance. To avoid surprises, it is important to check whether
        damage caused by the domestic help is covered. Are you not insured? Then
        HomeWorks can arrange that for you.
    - question: What can I expect from my help?
      answer: >-
        We look for the ideal help for you, so you can count on it being a good
        match. We find it important that our aids are reliable and accurate.
    - question: Does HomeWorks work everywhere?
      answer: Our cleaning service is offered throughout the Netherlands
